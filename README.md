Through the power of Github Actions you can convert a GLB file to USDZ file simply by uploading a file through Github's web UI. 

## Directions
1. Click the big green "Use as template" button to make a new repo based on this template
2. Use the github.com UI to upload a file to the [/source/assets](/source/assets) directoy
3. After the processing is complete, you can access your original GLB file-- and your freshly generated USDZ file in the [/dist/assets](/dist/assets) directory.
4. Open that USDZ file on your iPhone and view it in AR QuickLook mode
